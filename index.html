                  <p> The couple first met in late 2011 during Laser Tag by invitation from the short girl on the left. We struck it off, but wouldn't meet again til several months later.
                  These guys from Megan's high school would continue to be some of our closest friends til this day. 
                  </p>
                </div>
                  <div class="mySlides fade">
                  <img class="n-images" src="images/s3.jpg">
                  <p> Coincidentally the next year, we took the same university medical paper. We started studying together, and traveled out west together on the train. It was on the Western Line that Daniel would ask Megan to dinner and to play arcade games at the nerdiest place in town. That first date was on 19<sup>th</sup> of April 2012.</p>
                </div>
                  <div class="mySlides fade">
                  <img class="n-images" src="images/s4.jpg">
                  <p> Fast forward a few months, and we had already missed the yearly balls of our respective departments. Instead, we went to an architecture ball, where we knew noone. It didn't particularly matter, since we had each other.</p>
                </div>
                  <div class="mySlides fade">
                  <img class="n-images" src="images/s5.jpg">
                  <p> This was our first holiday trip together of many to come. We drove to Rotorua, Taupo, and  Tauranga. This picture was taken during the summer of 2014 on Maunganui beach.  </p>
                </div>
                  <div class="mySlides fade">
                  <img class="n-images" src="images/s6.jpg">
                  <p> Despite being a year apart, our graduations aligned due to Daniel's degree requiring one more year of study than Megan's. This 2014 autumn day was marked with friends, both sides of our family, and great food. We both continued with post-graduate studies the following year.</p>
                </div>
                  <div class="mySlides fade">
                  <img class="n-images" src="images/s7.jpg">
                  <p> Our first overseas trip was in Thailand at the end of 2014, and an incredible experience for us both. We experienced Thai food and culture for almost an entire month, and visited Daniel's extended family who were incredibly hospitable. We plan to return to Thailand as part of our South East Asia honeymoon.</p>
                </div>
                  <div class="mySlides fade">
                  <img class="n-images" src="images/s8.jpg">
                  <p> Two years later, Megan is still going strong with her PhD, while Daniel has become a software developer. With his new-found free time, he planned a trip to Japan. This is one of our favourite Japanese locations, the 10,000-gate shrine, Fushimi Inari-Taisha. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="mySlides fade">
                  <img class="n-images" src="images/s9.jpg">
                  <p> Little did Megan know, Daniel had planned more for Japan than just the trip. In 2017, during the snowy  February in Sapporo, Daniel proposed in a quiet street during the snow festival. Truthfully, they were lost in a foreign city, and he thought it would be good timing while they were surrounded by piles of snow with noone around. </p>
                </div>
                  <div class="mySlides fade">
                  <img class="n-images" src="images/s11.jpg">
                  <p> Turns out Daniel's software job had nice perks such as going to Fiji for the 2017 conference. Megan got to tag along too, and enjoyed everything up til this moment on the last day. From this point, Daniel would spend the rest of the trip complaining about his sunburnt toes.  </p>
                </div>
                  <div class="mySlides fade">
                  <img class="n-images" src="images/s12.jpg">
                  <p> Somehow, Megan won some tickets from Instagram to a wedding fair where she valiantly signed up for every competition possible. One of these competitions happened to be an engagement shoot that we won. Megan picked the botanical gardens weeks in advance, and Daniel found out the location as he was entering it into Google maps.</p>

                  <div class="mySlides fade">
                  <img class="n-images" src="images/s13.jpg">
                  <p> The next part of our journey is unknown, but we do know that this marks a new chapter in our lives. We hope to share this beginning with you, and create more memories to fondly look back on.  </p>

            <p>We are grateful enough to share this event with our closest friends and family. <br />
            We have spent the last 4 years living together, and are fortunate enough to have everything we need to build a home together,<br />
                other than Auckland home ownership.<br />

                If you would like to give a gift, in lieu of traditional housewares
               we have set up a honeymoon registry. <br />
                Thank you for being a part of our memories in Asia.</p>
